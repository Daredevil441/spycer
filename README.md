# spycer
Tool to display stl, gcode. Main feature - support rotations of bed for 5axes 3d printer.

Initially works with [goosli](https://github.com/l1va/goosli) backend (slicer for 5axes 3d printer), 
but can be easily adapted for any slicer. To work with goosli just update path to binary 
 in params.py.

Support gcode generated by Cura slicer.

Dependencies: python3, pyQt5, pyVTK.
